Any and all files required to run your software (even if intended for some infrastructure other than CS50 Codespaces), including source code as well as, if applicable, configuration files, Makefiles, sample inputs, SQLite databases, and so forth. Needless to say, all source code should be thoroughly commented.
A short video (that’s no more than 2 minutes in length) in which you present your project to the world, as with slides, screenshots, voiceover, and/or live action, ideally with you yourself appearing in the video. Your video should somehow include your project’s title, your name and year, your dorm/house and concentration, and any other details that you’d like to convey to viewers. See CS171’s tips on how to make a “screencast” though you’re welcome to use a phone or actual camera. Upload your video to YouTube as “public” or “unlisted” and include the URL of the video in your README.md file.
